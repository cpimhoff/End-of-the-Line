Howdy there! Glad you're here for your first day on the job. Folks seem to not want to be train conductors 'round these parts no more. 
Must be the desert heat - but it's a dry heat! And the cacti are all nice to look at and such.

Anyhow, I reckon alls you need to do is switch the tracks and such whenever you see fit. Not much else to do, really. Just flip the lever to the left and such to switch the left track,
and flip to the right and such to switch to the right track. Sometimes there might be a log and such in the way, but the train's got pretty strong wheels so you should be able to just roll straight through.

Oh and sometimes bugs and such might get some gunk on your windshield, but if that ever happens just push that button over yonder. Up in the top left and such.
You shouldn't need that much, though. The bugs don't really like the heat - but it's a dry heat!

That's just about it, I reckon. Things seem to be pretty calm around these parts and such.

Good luck, conductor! That's right, I'm talkin' to you - you're the conductor now!
